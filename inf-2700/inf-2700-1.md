# Relational Databases

* Database Management System is general purpose.
* Provided through server or library/software
* Data provided as different layers of abstractions

* Data that matters closer to HW/OS lvl
* ^Physically

* Logical Data that matters to an application (Users etc..)


* Relations are theoretical term of data synergy
* Relation Instance = Collection of all rows
* SQL Schema:

```sql
create table(varchar(5) /* len 5 */
name varchar(20) not null, /* not nil */
dept_name varchar(20), /* attri */
salary numeric(8, 2), /* int, 8x 2 int */
primary key(ID), /* identifier */
foreign key(dept_name) references department);
```


## SELECT

Pick attributes/touples where match

`dept_name="Comp.SCi"  AND salary >= 10E5 (insturcotr)`

```sql
select * from instructor 
where dept_name = 'Com.Sci' and salary >= 10E5;
```

## Project

`pi ID, name, salary (instructor)`

Distinct (no dupes) rows/attributes

```sql
select distinct /* ID,  */ name, salary from instructor;
```


## Expression

`pi name(sigma dept_name="Comp.Sci" and salary >= 10E5(instructor))`

```sql
select * from a and b;
```

## Cartesian Product

**Multiply tables**

```sql
select * from instructor, course;
```

## Natural Join

**Joining keys (no new key for same k in dif tables)** 

// Cartesian + Select -> derived

```sql
select * from instructor natural join course;
```

## Theta Join

> ins
 > teaches

Diff ids -> conditional where  (joining)

```sql
select * from a, b where a.id = b.woooya_id;
```

## Rename

```sql

with rich_instr(name, salary) as 
(
    select name, salary
    where a > b
) select * from rich_instr where a = c;
```

```sql
select name as ins_name;
from instructor as I, teach as T;
```

## Self Join

t x t = (same attri, diff rows)

```sql
select * from ; 
where a.i = b.i and a.pi <> b.pi; 
```

## Update

## Delete
